    title: Frequently asked questions
    questions:
      - question: How do I become a Microsoft Learn contributor?
        answer: There's more than one way to become a contributor! While editing documentation is the most popular method, you can also answer questions in Microsoft Q&A, leave feedback on documentation and training content, create a collection of content for others to consume, or file a GitHub issue if you spot problems in open-source product documentation but don't have the tools to fix them yourself.
      - question: What accounts do contributors need?
        answer: We recommend having a Microsoft Learn account and a GitHub account. A Microsoft Learn account allows you to contribute to Q&A and create collections, while a GitHub account allows you to edit our documentation or file an issue about open-source product documentation.
      - question: How do I start contributing to Microsoft Learn documentation?
        answer: Check out our contributor guide! Start with the article on [how to get started](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/content/?branch=main#how-do-i-start). You'll find a table that guides you to documentation for each contribution type and lists the account you'll need for each option. The contributor guide is your home base for learning how to get up and running as a Microsoft Learn contributor!
      - question: Who contributes to Microsoft Learn?
        answer: Anyone can contribute to Microsoft Learn. From first-time contributors to Microsoft MVPs, we see a range of experience and skill levels among folks contributing to the platform.
      - question: Do I need to be a Microsoft MVP to contribute to Microsoft Learn?
        answer: No! You don't need any special credentials or experience to contribute, just a desire to participate in the community.
      - question: What's in it for me?
        answer: Contributing to Microsoft Learn benefits not only our learners but also YOU! When you edit documentation, your name appears in the list of contributors at the top of the article. Your commits to our GitHub repos will show up in your GitHub commit history, which is a great way to demonstrate your passion for a particular technology while also building your portfolio. For some products, you can earn digital swag too, like badges.
      - question: How do I showcase my content?
        answer: Our Contributor Showcase program interviews contributors to learn about why they contribute and share their experiences with others. More information about this program is coming soon.
